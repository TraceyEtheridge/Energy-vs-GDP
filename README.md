## Project description
Total energy consumption is the key factor in each country's energy and climate change policy, which is influenced by economic growth, industrialization, urbanization, etc. This analyis chooses one of the most important influencing factors, GDP per capita, to analyze the relationship between these two variables and forecast the energy consumption in the next 5 years, which can be used to assist policy development in energy and climate change fields.

## Goals
* Analyse whether there is a relationship between a country's GDP per capita and energy consumption.
* Develop a model to predict future energy consumption based on GDP.
* Advise on potential energy and climate change policy development.

## Summary
* Linear regressing modelling showed a strong relationship between a country's GDP per capita and energy consumption.
* While predictions follow a similar trend to past data, extreme caution should be taken over predictions due to negative GDP forecasts for most of the world for 2020 which results in energy consumption showing a significant drop in 2020.
